        <p>
            I'm a Member of Technical Staff at Oracle, working on Generative AI as part of the Cloud DB Security team.<br>
            I'm graduating in June 2025 with double majors in Computer Science and Biological Sciences from BITS Pilani.<br>
            I'm passionate about applying technology in healthcare. Some projects I've worked on include developing a machine learning model to predict influenza virus mutation rates, and predicting the susceptibility of the UK population to diabetes and other chronic illnesses.<br>
            I'm especially interested in joining startups focused on AI-driven healthcare, precision oncology, and healthtech.
