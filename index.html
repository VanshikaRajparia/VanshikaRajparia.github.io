      <p>
        I'm a Software Developer at Oracle, working on Generative AI within the Cloud Database Security team to enhance the detection of security risks by generating concise, actionable audit insights.
        I graduated with dual degree in Msc. Biological Sciences and B.E. Computer Science from BITS Pilani.
        Some of the projects I've worked on include developing a Machine Learning model to predict influenza virus mutation rates, creating a full stack medical centre web app using MERN, and performed comparative analysis of ML models to predict the susceptibility of the UK population to diabetes and other chronic illnesses. </p>
        
        <p>I am extremely passionate about applying technology to healthcare, with a particular interest in AI-driven healthcare and healthtech innovations.  Iâ€™m eager to bring my interdisciplinary background to solving meaningful problems in this space.
