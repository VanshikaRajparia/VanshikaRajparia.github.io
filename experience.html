      <h2>Software Developer Intern, Oracle (Jul 2024 – Jun 2025)</h2>
      <p>Currently working as a part of the <strong> Cloud Database Security</strong> team at Oracle, where I used generative AI to generate  <strong>concise summaries of Audit Insights</strong>. The solution leverages <strong>Generative AI, LLMs, REST APIs, SQL</strong>, and <strong>Java</strong> to analyze and summarize insights of the asynchronously generated audit reports within Oracle DataSafe —a component of <strong>Oracle Cloud Infrastructure</strong>.</p>
      <p>Key Contributions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Developed and integrated the audit summary in the Audit Dashboard, using LLMs into asynchronously generated Audit Reports highlighting the crucial security fields that might cause potential security issues to the users data.</li>
        <li>Developed REST APIs, implemented security features, and conducted end-to-end testing for an Audit Policy module in Oracle Data Safe - a cloud-based service for securing Oracle databases.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Summer Research Intern, University of California, Los Angeles (Jun 2023 – Aug 2023)</h2>

      <img src="ios vmr_ucla.jpg" alt="UCLA EDRMS Project" style="width:100%; max-width:600px; margin:10px 0;">
      
      <p>Contributed to the development of an <strong>Electronic Dental Referral Management System (EDRMS)</strong> at UCLA School of Dentistry. This platform was built using <strong>Microsoft Power Platform</strong> and was intended to optimize referral workflows to maximize dental coverage across California's public schools.</p>
      
      <p>Key Contributions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Designed an ERD-based data model to manage dental referrals and streamline workflows.</li>
        <li>Built user interfaces and implemented business logic to automate and monitor referral status and enhanced overall oral health coverage by enabling data-driven decisions.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Summer Intern, Aktivolabs, Singapore (Jul 2022 – Aug 2022)</h2>
      <p>Engaged in data analytics projects to evaluate the <strong>susceptibility of the UK population to chronic diseases like diabetes</strong>. Focused on applying and comparing machine learning algorithms to develop predictive insights in the health tech domain.</p>
      <p>Key Contributions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Collected and preprocessed health and demographic data for analysis.</li>
        <li>Applied multiple ML models and performed a comparative study to identify the most effective one. Thus, enabled data-driven decisions by selecting optimal predictive strategies.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Summer Intern, Regional Remote Sensing Centre (RRSC), ISRO (May 2022 – Jul 2022)</h2>
      <p>Worked remotely with ISRO's Jodhpur RRSC to develop a model that detects solar panels using AI/ML techniques. This effort addressed a major gap in estimating solar power harnessed across Rajasthan.</p>
      <p>Key Contributions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Built an image recognition pipeline using <strong>RCNN</strong> for solar panel detection. Trained models on satellite imagery for accurate classification and location tagging.</li>
        <li>Completed a foundational course on image classification with TensorFlow.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Key Academic & Technical Projects</h2>
      <h3>CureCraft- MERN Stack App</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Designed a <strong> medical center management web app </strong> having functionalities like online appointment booking, rescheduling, viewing past appointments, and appointment reminders 24 hours prior.</li>
        <li> Incorporated the search functionality based on specialty of the doctor, added feature to upload prescriptions for easy future access by the patient, and prepared a dashboard to view overall statistics of themedical center by the admin.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Mutation Prediction Model for Influenza Virus</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Engineered features such as sequence conservation, GC content, mutation types, and structural positions.</li>
        <li>Developed a <strong>Random Forest Regressor</strong> to predict mutation probabilities in hemagglutinin and neuraminidase proteins.</li>
        <li>Introduced a weighted scoring mechanism to improve prediction accuracy.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Stock Price Prediction Using Tweet Sentiment</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Scraped tweets related to HDFC Bank using the <strong>ntscraper</strong> tool and analyzed them with the <strong>RoBERTa NLP model</strong>.</li>
        <li>Combined daily sentiment scores with historical stock prices to train a <strong>CNN-LSTM hybrid model</strong>.</li>
        <li>Achieved reliable short-term price predictions with real-world applicability.</li>
      </ul>
