      <h2>Software Intern, Oracle (Jul 2024 – Jun 2025)</h2>
      <p>Currently working in the <strong>Database Security</strong> team at Oracle Bangalore, where I am developing a system for generating <strong>concise summaries of Audit Insights</strong> using cutting-edge AI/ML technologies. The solution leverages <strong>Generative AI, LLMs, REST APIs, SQL</strong>, and <strong>Java</strong> to analyze and summarize audit trails within Oracle DataSafe—a component of <strong>Oracle Cloud Infrastructure</strong>.</p>
      <p>Key Contributions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Developed and integrated audit summarization features using LLMs into asynchronously generated reports.</li>
        <li>Built secure REST APIs and enforced security policies.</li>
        <li>Performed extensive unit and end-to-end testing of deployed components in production.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Summer Research Intern, University of California, Los Angeles (Jun 2023 – Aug 2023)</h2>
      <p>Contributed to the development of an <strong>Electronic Dental Referral Management System (EDRMS)</strong> at UCLA School of Dentistry. This platform was built using <strong>Microsoft Power Platform</strong> and was intended to optimize referral workflows to maximize dental coverage across California's public schools.</p>
      <p>Key Contributions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Designed an ERD-based data model to manage dental referrals and streamline workflows.</li>
        <li>Built user interfaces and implemented business logic to automate and monitor referral status.</li>
        <li>Enhanced overall oral health coverage by enabling data-driven decisions.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Summer Intern, Aktivolabs, Singapore (Jul 2022 – Aug 2022)</h2>
      <p>Engaged in data analytics projects to evaluate the <strong>susceptibility of the UK population to chronic diseases like diabetes</strong>. Focused on applying and comparing machine learning algorithms to develop predictive insights in the health tech domain.</p>
      <p>Key Contributions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Collected and preprocessed health and demographic data for analysis.</li>
        <li>Applied multiple ML models and performed a comparative study to identify the most effective one.</li>
        <li>Enabled data-driven decisions by selecting optimal predictive strategies.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Summer Intern, Regional Remote Sensing Centre (RRSC), ISRO (May 2022 – Jul 2022)</h2>
      <p>Worked remotely with ISRO’s Jodhpur RRSC to develop a model that detects solar panels using AI/ML techniques. This effort addressed a major gap in estimating solar power harnessed across Rajasthan.</p>
      <p>Key Contributions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Built an image recognition pipeline using <strong>RCNN</strong> for solar panel detection.</li>
        <li>Trained models on satellite imagery for accurate classification and location tagging.</li>
        <li>Completed a foundational course on image classification with TensorFlow.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Key Academic & Technical Projects</h2>
      <h3>RNA-Seq – Next Generation Sequencing Pipeline</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Constructed a targeted RNA-Seq pipeline using FastQC, Trimmomatic, and STAR for alignment.</li>
        <li>Generated custom GTF annotations and quantified gene expression from aligned reads.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Mutation Prediction Model for Influenza Virus</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Engineered features such as sequence conservation, GC content, mutation types, and structural positions.</li>
        <li>Developed a <strong>Random Forest Regressor</strong> to predict mutation probabilities in hemagglutinin and neuraminidase proteins.</li>
        <li>Introduced a weighted scoring mechanism to improve prediction accuracy.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Stock Price Prediction Using Tweet Sentiment</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Scraped tweets related to HDFC Bank using the <strong>ntscraper</strong> tool and analyzed them with the <strong>RoBERTa NLP model</strong>.</li>
        <li>Combined daily sentiment scores with historical stock prices to train a <strong>CNN-LSTM hybrid model</strong>.</li>
        <li>Achieved reliable short-term price predictions with real-world applicability.</li>
      </ul>
